{"object":"pantograph","aliases":["pantograph","collector"],"tags":["thin","metal","structure"],"prior":"Pantographs are typically composed of slender metal rods with a geometric link structure; coverage is often low (<10%), with fragmented and easily broken boundaries; common interference is slender backgrounds such as wires/supports.","failure_modes":["coverage too low (missing slender rods)","poor connectivity (broken into multiple segments)","false detection of thin background lines"],"suggestions":["coverage<0.1, prioritize split_image_patches","connectivity<0.6, use strong erosion/opening operations with caution","priority to preserve fine structure (light post-processing)"]}
